# Release notes

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

* All the public API names are now correctly marked `public` in Julia 1.11 and above. ([#83])

### Changed

* The string `repr` of `DatasetVersion` (e.g. `dataset.versions`) is now valid Julia code. ([#84])
* `JuliaHub.authenticate` will now fall back to force-authentication if the token in an existing `auth.toml` file is found to be invalid during authentication. ([#86])

### Fixed

* The `JuliaHub.update_dataset` function now correctly accepts the `license=(:fulltext, ...)` argument. ([#74])

## Version [v0.1.11] - 2024-06-27

### Added

* The `JuliaHub.authenticate` function now supports a two-argument form, where you can pass the JuliaHub token in directly, bypassing interactive authentication. ([#58])
* The `JuliaHub.submit_job` function now allows submitting jobs that expose ports (via the `expose` argument). Related to that, the new `JuliaHub.request` function offers a simple interface for constructing authenticated HTTP.jl requests against the job, and the domain name of the job can be accessed via the new `.hostname` property of the `Job` object. ([#14], [#52])

## Version [v0.1.10] - 2024-05-31

### Changed

* When submitting an appbundle with the two-argument `JuliaHub.appbundle(bundle_directory, codefile)` method, JuliaHub.jl now ensures that `@__DIR__` `@__FILE`, and `include()` in the user code now work correctly. There is a subtle behavior change due to this, where now the user script _must_ be present within the uploaded appbundle tarball (previously it was possible to use a file that would get filtered out by `.juliabundleignore`). ([#37], [[#53]])

## Version [v0.1.9] - 2024-03-13

### Fixed

* `JuliaHub.nodespec` now correctly prioritizes the GPU, CPU, and memory counts, rather than the hourly price, when picking a "smallest node for a given spec". ([#49])

## Version [v0.1.8] - 2024-02-21

### Added

* The progress output printing in `JuliaHub.upload_dataset` can now be disabled by setting `progress=false`. ([#48])

## Version [v0.1.7] - 2024-01-22

### Fixed

* `JuliaHub.datasets` and `JuliaHub.dataset` now handle problematic backend responses more gracefully. ([#46])

## Version [v0.1.6] - 2023-11-27

### Fixed

* `JuliaHub.appbundle`, when it has to generate a `Project.toml` file, now correctly includes it in the appbundle tarball. ([#44])
* `JuliaHub.appbundle` now works with relative paths such as `"."`. ([#44])

## Version [v0.1.5] - 2023-09-27

### Added

* The job submission APIs now support jobs with no time limit, and also can be used to submit jobs that trigger system image builds. ([#28])

### Fixed

* Fixed the submission of application-type jobs. ([#31], [#32], [#33], [#35])
* `JuliaHub.applications()` no longer throws a type error when the user has no registered and user applications. ([#33])
* Fixed the `show(io, x)` methods for `ComputeConfig` and `NodeSpec`. ([#34])

## Version [v0.1.4] - 2023-08-21

### Fixed

* `upload_dataset` and `download_dataset` no longer use the deprecated do-syntax to call the `rclone` binary. ([#18])

## Version [v0.1.3] - 2023-07-17

### Changed

* The `name` keyword argument to `submit_job` has been deprecated and replaced with `alias`. ([#13])

### Fixed

* `extend_job` now correctly handles the `200` but `success: false` response. ([#13])
* An assortment of small bugfixes revealed by JET. ([#9]) ([#12])

### Tests

* The test suite now runs successfully when the package is `Pkg.add`ed and the package files have only read-only permissions. ([#11])

## Version [v0.1.2] - 2023-06-26

### Fixed

* If TimeZones.jl fails to determine the system's timezone, JuliaHub.jl now gracefully falls back to UTC to represent dates and times. ([#7])

## Version [v0.1.1] - 2023-06-24

### Changed

* The `JuliaHub.download_job_file` function now returns the path of the relevant local file. ([#3])

### Fixed

* Jobs with files that have missing data are now handled gracefully by defaulting the `.size` property to `0` and `.hash` property to `nothing`. ([#3])
* Information about dataset versions can now be accessed via the the `.versions` property of a `Dataset` object. ([#2])
* The automatic backend API version detection is now more reliable in some edge cases. ([#1])

## Version [v0.1.0] - 2023-06-20

Initial package release.
